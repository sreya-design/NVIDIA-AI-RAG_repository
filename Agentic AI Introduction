🤖 Agentic AI – Notes & Concepts

This repository contains concise notes on Agentic AI, covering workflows, autonomy levels, design patterns, evaluations, and real-world applications.


What is Agentic AI?
An Agentic AI workflow is a process where an **LLM-based application executes multiple steps autonomously** to complete a task, often involving decision-making, tool usage, and reasoning across steps.

Disciplined Development Workflow
* Emphasizes structured, modular, and evaluable agent design
* Encourages traceability, error analysis, and iterative improvement

Agentic Workflow
* LLM executes **multiple sequential or parallel steps**
* Uses **tools, APIs, and external data**
* Can dynamically adapt its actions based on intermediate results

Degrees of Autonomy

1. Less Autonomous
  * Example: Essay writing using LLM + web search
  * All steps are predefined
  * Tool usage is hard-coded
  * Autonomy exists only in text generation

 2. Semi-Autonomous
  
  * Agent can make limited decisions
  * Tools are predefined
  * Partial flexibility in execution

 3. More Autonomous
  * LLM decides when and how to:
  
    * Perform web search
    * Query news or arXiv
    * Fetch PDFs and convert to text
  * Agent:
  
    * Makes many decisions independently
    * Can write new functions/tools dynamically

 Benefits of Agentic AI

* Parallelism
  → Multiple LLMs can work simultaneously

* Modularity
  → Components can be reused, replaced, or improved independently

Applications of Agentic AI

 1. Invoice Processing
PDF → Text Extraction → LLM → Database Update → Record Creation
 2. Customer Email Response
Email → LLM verifies order → Database query → LLM drafts response → Human review
3. Customer Service Agents
  * End-to-end autonomous support systems
  * Tool + database + reasoning integration
4. Visual Computer Use
  * Agent navigates webpages dynamically
  * Performs step-by-step reasoning while interacting with UI elements

Task Decomposition
  * Break a complex task into multiple smaller steps
  * Sequence execution logically to form a workflow

Building Blocks

1. Models
  * LLMs for:
    * Text generation
    * Tool use
  * Other AI models for:
    * PDF-to-text
    * Image analysis

2. Tools
  * Web search APIs (real-time data)
  * Database access
  * RAG systems for information retrieval

3. Code Execution
  * Execute scripts for validation, transformation, or automation

Evaluation of Agentic Systems

1. Manual Evaluation
   * Identify weak points and errors in outputs

2. Objective Evaluation
   * Automated, code-based checks

3. Subjective Evaluation
   * Use an LLM as a *judge* to determine correctness
   * Avoid strict 1–5 scale ratings (LLMs perform poorly here)

4. Trace-Based Analysis
   * Examine each step taken by the agent
   * Useful for debugging and backtracking

 Agentic Design Patterns

 1. Reflection
  * LLM evaluates its own output
  * Example:
      * Generate code → Critique → Debug → Re-run
  * Can use:
      * Same LLM
    * Separate **Critic Agent**

 2. Tool Use

  * Web search
  * Code execution
  * Database queries

 3. Planning

  * LLM decides:
      * Action sequence
    * API calls
  * More flexible but **harder to control**

 4. Multi-Agent Workflow
  * Multiple agents collaborate
  * Produces better outputs
  * Increased complexity and control challenges
